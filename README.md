The goal is to mix instagram and google+ UI. Adding a zoom bar for single view page. Now only Chrome support full feature. Also no mobile version, because I believe for image viewing app it'd better to have a different page for mobile device.

ver 0.1 roughly fulfiled all the features in my mind, but there are still many improvements to do, like add loading animation, resize image for window size change. Plus I'm not satisfied with the style of those comments (and the animation of the date tag), but I've no idea how to make beautiful text container. 

The single view interface is inspired by [gamma gallery](https://github.com/codrops/GammaGallery).
