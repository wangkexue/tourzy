The goal is to mix instagram and google+ UI.

ver 0.1 roughly fulfiled all the features in my mind, but there are still many improvements to do, like add loading animation, resize image for window size change. Plus I'm not satisfied with the style of those comments (and the animation of the date tag), but I've no idea how to make beautiful text container. 

The single view interface is inspired by [gamma gallery](https://github.com/codrops/GammaGallery).
